## Why DeMed

The need of vaccines are always a undoubted need for the society. Recently we came to notice many scams in this sector. From public not being aware about the availability of life saving vaccines to black sale of medicines by authorities is a threat to common man. What about all these data being visible to the public? This is when the thought of DeMed arouse. DeMed is a decentralized App tracking the vaccine distribution, which helps user to locate the nearest hospital having the required vaccines. One can enable their location and find the nearby hospitals and the availability of vaccines there. We are tracking the supply of vaccines from the manufacturers itself, and make the transactions transparent, thereby reduces the scam.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
